# Questions & Comments

1. Why is "Local Initiatives" under "About"?
2. Can we make "News" and "Events" into "Calendar" and "Blog"? (Or just Blog - I don't personally favor the calendar but others might).
3. "Campaigns" vs. "Our Initiatives & Projects" - which one?
3. List of menu links to keep:
	1. Home &check;
	2. About &check;
	3. Contact &check;
	4. Initiatives & projects *or* Campaigns &check;
	5. Blog &check;
	6. Resources &check;
	7. Donate &check;
	8. Get Involved &check;
	   1. Still need form for it

**NB: Forms will be obtained via wordpress. Copied in a form for now but it is nonfunctional.**

### Other Issues

1. Need a footer
   1. What goes in the footer?
2. Need blog post styling
3. Need to decide on content chunks for each page
4. Need to get rid of some redundant code whose only difference is the page marker
5. Need to make a newsletter sign-up chunk
6. Should any sections have a gray background?
7. Follow [this woman's tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) for making Wordpress sites from scratch
   1. Is from 2015 so a bit out of date - hope not much has changed!



## Questions:

1. Can we combine "Events" and "News"? I think they could both be housed under "Blog", with a "Calendar" page if you want one. (I am neutral on the calendar page.) &rarr;Â **Yes**
2. "Local Initiatives", "Initiatives & Projects", "Campaigns": 1), this needs consistent naming, 2) do we still want it?, 3) if so, what are the modern incarnations of such projects?
3. Why is a sampling of "Local Initiatives" on the About page? Shouldn't we put something like social media contacts there instead?
