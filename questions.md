# Questions & Comments

1. Why is "Local Initiatives" under "About"?
2. Can we make "News" and "Events" into "Calendar" and "Blog"? (Or just Blog - I don't personally favor the calendar but others might).
3. "Campaigns" vs. "Our Initiatives & Projects" - which one?
3. List of menu links to keep:
	1. Home &check;
	2. About &check;

## Questions:

1. Can we combine "Events" and "News"? I think they could both be housed under "Blog", with a "Calendar" page if you want one. (I am neutral on the calendar page.) &rarr; **Yes**
2. "Local Initiatives", "Initiatives & Projects", "Campaigns": 1), this needs consistent naming, 2) do we still want it?, 3) if so, what are the modern incarnations of such projects? &rarr; **Undecided**
3. Why is a sampling of "Local Initiatives" on the About page? Shouldn't we put something like social media contacts there instead? &rarr; **If you want it different, map out page sections you'd prefer**
