        <p>The Richmond DSA is an all-volunteer organization of advocates, organizers, and community members with the goal of building working class power in the city of Richmond, Virginia. We seek to promote a truly democratic and socialist&nbsp;society.</p>
        <p>We act by educating our members and neighbors on the importance of unified struggle, supporting progressive legislation, opposing bills designed to benefit profiteers at the expense of the community, and standing in solidarity with oppressed and marginalized groups through mutual aid&nbsp;efforts.</p>
        <p>We reject an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race or sex, and brutality and violence in defense of the status&nbsp;quo.</p>
        <p>We invite supporters and members from all stations and backgrounds to join us in bringing about meaningful change to our community, to our city, and to the&nbsp;Commonwealth.</p>
